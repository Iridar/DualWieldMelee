[h1]Dual melee wielding[/h1]

When you equip a melee weapon in the secondary weapon slot and the primary weapon slot (using the "Primary Secondaries" mod)
this mods converts your soldier to dual wielding melee.
You can use and combine any melee weapon (either from the game or from a mod) except the skirmisher claws and the templars psi gauntlets because these are technically already dual weapons.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Dual melee does two slashes per attack.

The primary weapons slash will do full damage, the slash of the secondary weapon will do half the regular weapons damage.

Supported classes by default:
- Ranger
- Samurai
- LWOTC Shinobi
- RPGO Soldier

How to support custom classes?

add allowed weapon type to the XComClassData.ini of that class mod.

[code]
+AllowedWeapons=(SlotType=eInvSlot_PrimaryWeapon, WeaponType="sword")
+AllowedWeapons=(SlotType=eInvSlot_SecondaryWeapon, WeaponType="sword")
[/code]
